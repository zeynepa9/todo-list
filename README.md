# TODO List

This project is a dynamic and modular to-do application that allows users to manage their daily tasks effectively. It was created as an assignment for The Odin Project's JavaScript curriculum, focusing on advanced JavaScript features, Web Storage API, and modern development workflows.

## Overview

The TODO List app enables users to create, manage, and organize tasks within projects. Each task contains details such as title, description, due date, and priority level. The application offers a default project for initial tasks while allowing the creation of custom projects for better organization.

## Features

- Object-oriented JavaScript with constructors/classes for task and project management.
- Dynamic rendering of tasks and projects.
- User ability to view, add, and delete tasks and projects.
- Task properties including title, description, due date, and priority.
- Persistent data storage using the Web Storage API (`localStorage`).
- Modular code separated into logical files and modules.
- Interactive UI with the capability to toggle between projects and tasks.

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript ES6: For app logic and DOM manipulation.
- Web Storage API: For persistent storage of tasks and projects.
- HTML5 and CSS3: For structure and styling.
- webpack: For asset bundling and development workflow.
- npm: For script running and package management.
- Babel: For backward compatibility of ES6 features.
- Git: For version control.
- GitHub Pages: For deployment.

## Lessons Learned

The development of the TODO List app emphasized several essential concepts:

- The importance of separating application logic from DOM manipulation.
- Managing and organizing code using modules.
- Persisting data between sessions with `localStorage`.
- JSON for data serialization and storage.
- Restoring object methods after retrieving data from `localStorage`.
- Event handling and dynamic content generation.
- Deployment practices using GitHub Pages.

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run `npm install` to install the necessary node modules.
3. Use `npm run build` to compile the project using webpack.
4. Open the `dist/index.html` file in your web browser to see the app locally.
